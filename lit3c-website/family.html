									<h3 class="major">My family</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>My family currently lives in the same household. 
									It is composed of my two siblings(older and younger brother), two parents(mom and dad), and two grandparents(mother side).
									To the left is our family photo taken during Christmas Eve. AS you can see there are also three dogs included in the photo.
									We consider our dogs as part of the family. Our cat wasn't home at the time we took the picture so he was not included. Currently,
									We now have two more dogs making it five dogs in total. Another stray cat also decided to stay in our home so that's plus one for the cats.
									My grandparents in my mom's side are also living within our household but unfortunately, I don't have a recent photo of them. They probably
									don't want their photo taken either way. Sometimes our relatives would visit our home during events like fiestas, birthdays, or holidays. One another
									note, my mom's sister is also a returning OFW who, in the writing of this text, is also staying in our home.</p>
