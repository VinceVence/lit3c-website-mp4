									<h3 class="major">Hmmmm... what do I like?</h3>
									
									<h1><center>Chess is like life... I don't know what I'm doing</center></h1>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>I have lived almost a quarter of my life moving pieces within the chessboard.
									Nonetheless, it could be obvious that I'm interested with the game as mentioned in other pages. I fully understand that for most people, the game may
									not be that appealing or the entry point might seem intimidataing but I beg to differ. When I first started playing chess, I've been in the position where
									I deduced the fun limitations of the game. You see, what I've noticed is that, during school sporting events, chess usually is the most unwatched sports solely
									due to its nature. It is encouraged to have a quiet environment and as much as possible minimize distraction. When compared to sports like basketball or football, 
									the hype and cheering is completely far off. Therefore, labeling chess at that standpoint may already be far from interesting aside from people who prefer long boring quiet
									endeavors. For me, on the other hand, I wasn't the kind of students who engages a lot with other people. I also find it bothersome to engage in activities that requires
									a lot of movements especially those that makes you sweat. Due to that, chess was really my strong suit because it does not need a lot of movements nor a lot of interaction with other people.
									Finding chess interesting is somewhat cynical in a sense where the game is often attributed to philosophy, strategic thinking, or even life in general. Remember that Beth Harmon
									film, Queen's Gambit? Maybe it did spark your interest in the game.</p>
									
									<h1><center>print("Programming")</center></h1>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/interest1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I mean... I'm currently taking Computer Science right now so it's kind of given already. To clearly emphasize, it's not the raw
									programming experience that I find interesting, but the possibilities that could be done or the opportunities to innovate within the field. I'm striving my best to become an AI
									engineer and it's the kind of field that I would like to dedicate my life pursuing. I've always been fond of programming, specifically the intersections and umbrellas within AI. This may range from
									Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and many more. The first time I was able to create an image classification Deep Learning model, I found the experience ecstatic. That mere moment
									where I took a picture of a fish from the internet and fed it as an input in my fish classification model, was the eureka experience I will never forget. It might seem weird and unpopular to find
									the academe pathway as interesting. Oftentimes, scietific and mathematics field are regarded as "boring" but for me it's something I've always enjoyed. Although, I may now be very good at it unfortunately.</p>
									
									<h1><center>In to the Books we go</center></h1>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/interest2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I'm interested in reading books especially biographies. I've walked through history, from Van Gogh,
									to Edison, then Tesla and also Einstein. Biographies of people who built Computer Science and pioneered technological advancement. I've strolled towards the life of Babbage and Byron, Alan Turing,
									Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Bezos, Zuckerberg, and many others. Aside from biographies, I'm also fond of Novels. Eastern literature intrigues me especially those written by Japanese authors. Sometimes,
									when I get a bit motivated, I venture out on academic books. Statistics, Calculus, algorithms, IoT are just some of the books I challenge myself to start reading. Although, I admit these kinds of books
									are difficult to comprehend especially if it's for self-study where there are no guidance from an informeed instructor or subject matter expert.</p>
