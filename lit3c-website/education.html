									<h3 class="major">My Education</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/educ1.jpg" alt="" /></span>I went to <strong>West Visayas State University - Integrated Laboratory School (WVSU-ILS)</strong> for a decade.
									I've started studying there since Kindergarten up to Junior High School. The school ambiance is still familiar because I have lots of memories there. Since it's a
									semi-private school, my batch did not have that many students compared to public schools. The maximum number of students, I think, was only 70 during elementary school, and it went
									down to just 35 in Junior High School. The school is located here within my home city - Iloilo and it's just a jeepney ride away from home. I never had lots of memories with my
									classmates even if I went their for a decade, but most of what I could recall was limited within clasroom endeavors and high school events. This might be due to me spending most
									of my school days in front of the chessboard. I always looked forward for my after class trainings when I was still studying at WVSU. The only down side was that, the school 
									is more on academic focused. This means that not a lot of opportunities are given to the athletes. There were no extensive sports program even if an athletic department exists. Nevertheless,
									I could go on about my experience there for hours but I think I've already discussed the gist of it.</p>
									
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/educ2.jpg" alt="" /></span>When I transitioned to Senior High School, I transferred to <strong>Central Philippine University (CPU)</strong> which is also located at Iloilo City. I stayed 
									there for two years and most of my days were spent on academics. I figured that I missed out most on my studies during Junior High School due to constant class pullouts to prepare
									for tournaments or compete in other areas away from my hometown. I've spent a lot of time in computer cafes playing computer games with my new found classmates but I made sure that 
									I never neglected my studies. It was a fun and productive experience. I would prefer it more compared to my Junior High School days since I have more friends and encountered more social
									social events.</p>
									
									<p>Right now at college, I'm obviously attending at <strong>Lyceum of the Philippines University - Manila</strong>. At first, it was hard for me to adjust since I came from
									"the province" and the new environment is clearly different. The primary reason why I chose this school is for scholarship purposes. I was given the chance to represent
									LPU for the NCAA Chess competitions and I figured that if I don't take this opportunity now, I might regret it later on.
